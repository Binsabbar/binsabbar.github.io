# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, built with Jekyll.

## Running Locally

To run the website locally, you'll need to have Ruby and Bundler installed. It's recommended to use a Ruby version manager like `rbenv`.

1.  **Install Ruby:**
    Follow the instructions to install `rbenv` and a modern version of Ruby (e.g., 3.3.0).

2.  **Install Bundler:**
    ```bash
    gem install bundler
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

4.  **Run the Server:**
    To start the Jekyll server, run:
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
    The website will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

## Technologies Used

*   **Jekyll:** A simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
*   **GitHub Pages:** The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.
*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** The core technologies for the website's structure, styling, and interactivity.
