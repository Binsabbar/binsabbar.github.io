### CLI Tool for monitoring Gitlab Pipelines
During covid-19 and lockdown, I wanted to utilise my time with something interesting. During my day, I needed to track multiple projects build status for over 50 projects. It was hard and time consuming. Sometimes I forget to check, the other time I lose track and focus on my main task. 

So I wanted something simple that I can glimpse at.I was using Gitlab, and did not provide a Dashboard that dispalyed all pipeline status. So I created a simple cli tool that will monitor and check projects that I am interested in. It is the simplest and fastest thing I could make in such a limited time, while getting value out of it. Also, some people enjoy cli based tools more.
